- Load microarray dataset into R
- Explore the dataset with basic visualizations
- Identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
- Generate annotation of the DEGs

# Cleft Lip and Palate

<img align="right" src="images/cleft.jpg" width="300px" title="Cleft Lip and Palate">

Cleft lip and cleft palate (**CLP**) are splits in the upper lip, the roof of the mouth (palate) or both. They result when facial structures that are developing in an unborn baby do not close completely. CLP is one of the most common birth defects with a frequency of 1/700 live births.

## Challgenes

Children with cleft lip with or without cleft palate face a variety of challenges, depending on the type and severity of the cleft.

- **Difficulty feeding.** One of the most immediate concerns after birth is feeding.

- **Ear infections and hearing loss.** Babies with cleft palate are especially at risk of developing middle ear fluid and hearing loss.

- **Dental problems.** If the cleft extends through the upper gum, tooth development may be affected.

- **Speech difficulties.** Because the palate is used in forming sounds, the development of normal speech can be affected by a cleft palate. Speech may sound too nasal.

## Genetics

<a href="https://swissmodel.expasy.org/repository/uniprot/O14896" title="SWISS-MODEL Protein Structure of IRF6"><img align="right" src="images/structure.png" width="300px" title="SWISS-MODEL Protein Structure of IRF6"></a>

- DNA variation in [Interferon Regulatory Factor 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRF6) ([**IRF6**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRF6)) causes [Van der Woude syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Woude_syndrome) ([**VWS**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Woude_syndrome))

- VWS is the most common syndromic form of cleft lip and palate.

- However, the causing variant in IRF6 has been found in *only* 70% of VWS families!

- IRF6 is a **transcription factor** with a conserved helix-loop-helix DNA binding domain and a less well-conserved protein binding domain.

## Question

Given:

1. The pathogenic variant in IRF6 exists in only 70% of the VWS families

2. IRF6 is a transcription factor

How can we identify other genes that might be involved in the remaining 30% of the VWS families?

**Hint:** Typically, genes regulated by the same transcription factor belong to the same biological process or pathway.

<details>
  <summary>Click here for the answer</summary>
By comparing the gene expression patterns between wild-type (functional) **Irf6** and knockout (non-functional) **Irf6**, it will be possible to identify genes that are regulated (targeted) by **Irf6**.

## Hypothesis

- \(H_O : \mu_{WT} = \mu_{KO}\)

- \(H_A : \mu_{WT} \ne \mu_{KO}\)

- Where \(\mu\) is the *mean* of the gene expression values of a gene.

- **One**-sided or **Two**-sided testing?

```{r sides, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=2}
n = 1e6
cutoff = qnorm(0.05)
mydata = data.frame(x = rnorm(n))
left = mydata %>% filter(x < cutoff)
right = mydata %>% filter(x > -cutoff)
both = mydata %>% filter(x < cutoff | x > -cutoff)

binwidth = 1e-1

p = ggplot()
p = p + geom_histogram(data = mydata, aes(x = x), fill = "gray", binwidth = binwidth)
p = p + geom_histogram(data = left, aes(x = x), fill = "red", binwidth = binwidth)
p = p + labs(x = "", y = "")
p = p + theme_light()

# Why Microarray?

![](images/one-does-not-simply.jpg)


<img align="right" src="images/chip.jpg" width="300px" title="Microarray Chip">

- No need for candidate genes (or genes of interest)

- One experiment assesses the entire transcriptome

- One experiment generates many hypotheses

- Only small amount of RNA is required (~15–200 ng)

## Experimental Design

- 3 IRF6 wild-type (+/+) and 3 knockout (-/-) mouse embryos.
- E17.5 embryos were removed from euthanized mothers.
- Skin was removed from embryos.
- Total RNA was isolated from the skin.
- Resultant RNA was hybridized to [Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/900497#/900497) arrays.

## Dataset

- The original dataset can be obtained from NCBI GEO with accession [GSE5800](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE5800)

```{r dataset, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
df = read_tsv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmedmoustafa/Notebooks/master/Irf6/Irf6.tsv")[1:4,]
head(df)
